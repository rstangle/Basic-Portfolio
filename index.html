            <p>Now this is a story all about how. My life got flipped-turned upside down. And I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there. I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air.</p>

            <p>In west Philadelphia born and raised, On the playground was where I spent most of my days. Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool, And all shooting some b-ball outside of the school. When a couple of guys who were up to no good, Started making trouble in my neighborhood. I got in one little fight and my mom got scared. She said, "You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air."</p>
